RabbitMQ:

WHat is RabbitMq? WHat are the advantages of RabbitMQ:

--> RabbitMQ is an message broker which uses AMQP i.e Advanced Message Queueing Protocol to communicate asynchronously between multiple micro-services by publishing and receiving messages.

It accepts messages from producers, routes them via exchanges, stores them in queues, and delivers them to consumers. Thats how it works.

Benefits:

1. Aysnchronous communication: It allows async communication between multiple microsrvices. i.e Producers can publish message and move on, it doesnt wait for response. Consumer can process message based on availability of threads.

2. Decoupling: Producers and consumers can work independently without knowing each others specific details.

3. Security: It uses AMQP protocol which ensure shat all communications happenes in consumer and publisher are secure. 


Key concepts of RMQ:

1. Binding: Binding is connection or link between  Exchange and queuue.

2. Routing Key: Routing key is basically used by Exchanges to route traffic to queue.

3. Exchange: Exchange is an intermediate or central hub which receieves message from Producer and routes messages to appropriate queue based on routingKeys or exchange types.


Types of exchanges:

1. Topic exchange: Topic exchange route messages to queue based on wildcard matches between routingKey and binding key.

2. Fanout Exchange : A fanout exchange routes messages to all queues that are linked to it and ignore the routing key.
