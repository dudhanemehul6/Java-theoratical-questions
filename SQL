1. What is index? and what are its types:

--> Index is basically used to improve the performance of query. its basically used for faster searching and faster retrival of data.


Their are two types of indexes:
1. Clustered index: Clustered index defines the physical order in which data should be stored. 

2. Non clustered index: Non clustered index doesn not define the physical order in which data should be stored. it stores data at one place and index at one place where index contain the  address or pointer to the location of  data. Its similar to index of book where we have subjects/topics and its page no. where its available.
