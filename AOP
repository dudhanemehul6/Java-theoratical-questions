AOP:

What is AOP?

---> AOP is basically Aspect oriented programming which helps devlopers to define/write aspects i.e common behaviors that can run before, after, or around specific method executions without modifying the actual code of those methods.

For example, instead of writing logging code inside every service method, we can create a single “LoggingAspect” class that automatically logs entry and exit of all service methods.
This reduces code duplication and keeps our business logic clean.
